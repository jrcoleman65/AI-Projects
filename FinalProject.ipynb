This systematic review and meta-analysis included 80 randomized controlled trials, demonstrating that DMH interventions can significantly lower symptoms of depression (Hedges g = -0.61) and anxiety (Hedges g = -0.73). The findings suggest that DMH tools, such as mobile apps and internet-based therapies, can bridge the treatment gap in LMICs, where 80-95% of individuals with mental health disorders do not receive adequate care. Future project ideas could focus on developing and optimizing specific DMH interventions tailored to various populations within LMICs, leveraging existing digital health platforms to enhance accessibility and engagement. Additionally, research could explore the integration of DMH tools with traditional care models to improve overall mental health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations.
